<h2>More than One million</h2>
<h3>species have already faced extinction due to global warming. Global warming does not simply cause a significant increase in the temperature of Earth but also leads to the destruction of habitats and ecosystems.</h3>

<div class="r p2">
<h2>No matter where you live</h2>
<h3>forests make a difference to the quality of life for your family, your community and all living things. As forests become less resilient, climate change accelerates, water becomes more scarce and air becomes more polluted and more difficult to breathe.</h3>

<div class="r p3">
<h2>According to non-British scientists</h2>
<h3>rising carbon dioxide levels and warmer temperatures lead to terrible air quality and ground level ozone will also have devastating impact. Temperature fluctuation, extreme weather events and related health effects (new and forgotten illnesses) are straight ahead.</h3>

<h1>What Would You Do About It?</h1>
<div class="s">The routine decisions that shape our days may seem small, but collectively they have a big effect on global warming. We can all make choices that will greatly reduce our global warming impact. Using public transport, sharing a car with your friends or colleagues, walking or biking whenever possible will each have a slight but global, positive effect. Here are a few smart things you can do to help tackle global warming:
</div>
<div class="lc">
<h3>At Home</h3>
<ol>
<li>Replace your five most frequently used fixtures to <b>energy saving</b> light bulbs.</li>
<li><b>Reduce</b>, <b>reuse</b> and <b>recycle</b> in your home - conserve energy.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="lc">
<h3>At Work</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>Convince your colleagues to use a <b>paperless office</b> model.</li>
<li><b>Power cut</b> your workstation when you go home. (You should skip this if you are a Server Operator!)</li>
</ol>
